        <h1>Site Plan for the Mildred Online Store</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Site Name: SERENA MILDRED ONLINE BOUTIQUE (SMOB) </h2>
        <p>The site was named after my youngest child Serena Mildred, who loves to pretend she has wares to sell. She
            turned 4 on June 13th, 2024. While preparing for her birthday the idea of building an online shop got stuck
            in
            my mind. </p>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the site is to give me a platform to reach out to visitors and customers to make purchases of
            their
            sports wears, clothing, apparels and accessories online while making the process seamless and intuitive.
            Products
            will be displayed along
            with some information such as the price, current status, customer reviews, along with a form for a
            newsletter subscription.</p>
        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>The chosen colors are:
            #93e5ab-#ff5733-#ffccd5-#4f0074-#00241b while palette link is <a
                href="https://coolors.co/93e5ab-ff5733-ffccd5-4f0074-00241b"> here. </a> </p>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>The site will use the following Google Fonts: Kalnia Glaze for the website logo, Ubuntu for the headings and
            Rubik for the other information</p>
