Site Name: The site or domain name is the primary identifier and is critical for branding, visibility, and recognition,
often coupled with a logo or logo version. A representative domain that is available to purchase would be normally
important but not required in this class. Provide a valid site name that is relevant to your project and a short reason
why the the site name was selected.
Example: Bay Area eBiking Club
• This name represents a club that is focused on electric biking in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Optional domain availability: bay-ebike.org

Site Purpose: The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website content in describing what services and
information will be provided.
Example: for the Bay Area eBiking Club
• The site provides a hub for regional e-biking by listing providing trail and e-bike recommendation information along
with a membership information form.
Scenarios: Scenarios are questions that are asked by a site visitor who represents the target audience of the
organization or company. The questions will help you drive the content of the website as it provides answers to the
questions. Again, much of the content specifications will actually be provided but start thinking about the target
audience of the site. Include at least two scenarios.
Example: for the Bay Area eBiking Club
• What is the best e-bike to get for mountainous areas?
• Where can I find contact information for the club's directors?
Color Schema: The color schema refers to the carefully selected site colors. Define at least two colors and show where
each color selected will be used, such as headings, paragraphs, background colors, accents, and so on.
! Use your selected color schema on this document.

Typography: The typography section of the planning document provides examples of the fonts to be used and where they are
to be applied. No less than one font and no more than three fonts selections need to be selected. Indicate where each
selected font will be used (such as headings, body, and so on). Other fonts can be used for special circumstances or
sections as needed.

Wireframe: Design a wireframe of your project's home page layout. Wireframe diagrams can be simple and do not need to
have actual content, just representations of content and their layout relationship. Provide a sketch for the mobile view
and for an larger, such as desktop, view for the home page.
What is a Wireframe? - evolve
Remember that earlier in the course we worked with a given wireframe. Country/Place Page
CSS
Add supporting CSS files as needed. The styling can be basic.
Be sure to use your selected color schema and typography listed in this plan on your site plan document.
Testing

accessibility, best practices, color contrast, SEO, and performance.

            my mind. </p>

        <p>The purpose of the site is to give me a platform to reach out to visitors and customers to make purchases of
            sports apparels online while making the process seamless and intuitive. Products will be displayed along
            with some information such as the price, current status, customer reviews, along with a form for a
            newsletter subscription.</p>
