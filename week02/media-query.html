            <h2>Mosiah 18: 8 - 9</h2>
            <p>8 And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they
                called) and now,
                as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear
                one anotherâ€™s
                burdens, that they may be light;</p>
            <p>

                9 Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of
                comfort, and to
                stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even
                until death, that ye
                may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal
                life</p>
